## **Log**

### **R1D1**
**Today's Progress** : I’m learning Android Programming with Udacity now. I started with intent, activities, concept of array and looping in Android.

**Thoughts** : This is my first time learning Android and I’m really enjoying it. I hope I can complete this chalengge and become a Android developer.

### **R1D2**
**Today's Progress** : Learning the concept of view recycling and android performance.

**Thoughts** : Need to learn more, but I don't have enough time to learn about this (I'm really sleepy 
:sleepy:). I hope tomorrow i can understand about view recycling more than today.

### **R1D3**
**Today's Progress** : Learning the concept of view recycling (ListView) and adapter again and a little about tools namespace. Let's hope tomorrow i can learn more about android.

**Thoughts** : I'm really excited to learn more about view recycling (not just about ListView but about GridView and RecyclerView too). I should make a lot of progress tomorrow.
