## **Log**

### **R1D1**
**Today's Progress** : I’m learning Android Programming with Udacity now. I started with intent, activities, concept of array and looping in Android.

**Thoughts** : This is my first time learning Android and I’m really enjoying it. I hope I can complete this chalengge and become a Android developer.
